# Naming Conventions

Using Naming Conventions for Plugins is very simple all plugin packages have to be in the same folder as the collector (in this case `main.py`) and have to be named after a certain convention (in this case have to start with `plugin_`).

Assuming you are in this folder, type `python main.py` to show all discovered plugins.
