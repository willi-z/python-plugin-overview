# Namespaces

You might not know that namespaces are simply another name for a python module and therfore consits only of a folder with a certain name and an `__init.py` - file
Using namespaces to dicover python plugins allows to have more freedom in naming the plugins, but restricts the location where to locat them.

In this case the both plugins (`plugin_a` and `pluginb`) does not follow any naming conventions, but have to be placed in `myapp/plugins/`.
To run the namespace example run: `python main.py`
